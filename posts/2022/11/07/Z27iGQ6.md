This is my first automated post to Twitter, powered by Raycast and GitHub Actions!

---

So... how does it work? I created a custom Raycast extension (not released yet) that generates and commits posts directly to GitHub. I also wired together a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/natemoo-re/feed/blob/18564b57813cd76f7fa422ecafdbe4bb0d6b4acc/.github/workflows/post.yml) that strips any Markdown content from the post, generates a link to `feed.nmoo.dev` and posts a new status to Twitter.

---

Overengineered? Maybe... but it's been very fun to build. Plus now I'll have a backup of all my tweets and unlimited room to add context with longer-form content like this!

Also, Elon Musk is a giant baby. And I can say that because he doesn't own this website, I do.
