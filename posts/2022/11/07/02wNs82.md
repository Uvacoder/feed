Some major updates to this project! ðŸŽ‰

Posts are now sorted by date, filenames are automatically generated, and best of all... I can author posts directly from Raycast using a custom extension. They're commited directly to GitHub and are live in a matter of seconds.

Feels like a pretty sweet workflow.
